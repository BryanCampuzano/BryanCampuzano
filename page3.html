    <p>I had to make a poem in my 11th grade English class. The hardest part of my poem was the rhyme scheme. And finding a topic was pretty hard to come up with. The best part was when I was in the zone and I had a general idea of where the poem was going. A sonnet is a poem that can follow a variety of rhyme schemes and different sets of rules but the one I used was a shakespearean sonnet. Shakespeare follows the scheme A B A B  C D C D  E F E F and the couplet G G.</p><p class = "poem"></br>“Poodle”</br></br>I once had a pet named Dog</br>One day we went for a walk</br>He after a green frog</br>Chased him all the way to Bangkok</br></br>I ended up in a place called Khao San</br>Women offering me fried noodles</br>But there I met an old man</br>Asking if I had found my poodle</br></br>Tired and wanting to come back</br>Walking back all sad</br>Hopping back into my Cadillac</br>The sound of a frog made me feel sad</br></br>Croak sounding louder down the road</br>Out comes a poodle licking a blue toad</p>
