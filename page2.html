    <p>My Duck Game is the reconstruction of the game Duck Hunt. Nintendo's game was a really good game and was the childhood of a lot of people. So I decided to take that and make it my own using SVG. It took a long time, a lot of questions, and plenty of deleting stray brackets. My game can be played by clicking on this image.</p>
