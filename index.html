    <p>Hey! I am Bryan Campuzano and I am part of a family of four. I am a 17 year old 11th grader and a student here at PHS. Pasadena High School is a good school with plenty of opportunities. I joined App Academy because I really like computers. I really liked computers and their hardware components so I went into the software end. Here in App Academy we learn a lot of coding and being able to create complex websites and programs with just letters, numbers and symbols.</p>
